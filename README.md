##### By Cassidy Gorsky and Vivian Xia

The repository includes the links to our script that contains the script of how we cleaned and analyzed the movie data as well the data exploration dashboard
for our MA346 Final Project.
The goal of this project is to explore movie data from https://www.the-numbers.com/ and create a machine learning model 
to predict if the average gross per movie of distributors will increase or decrease in the following year using distributor share and ticket sales.
The following are the links to the various deliverables of the project:
