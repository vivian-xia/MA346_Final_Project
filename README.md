# MA346_Final_Project
##### By Cassidy Gorsky and Vivian Xia

The repository includes the links the notebooks of data cleaned and analyzed for movie data as well the data exploration dashboard
for our MA346 Data Science Final Project.

The goal of this project is to explore movie data from [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/) and create a machine learning model 
to predict if the average gross per movie of distributors will increase or decrease in the following year using distributor share and ticket sales.
